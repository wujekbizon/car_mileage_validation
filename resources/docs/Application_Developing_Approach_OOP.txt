Yes, using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a suitable approach for developing this car mileage validation application. OOP principles can help organize the code, improve modularity, and enhance maintainability.

Regarding the user interface (UI), you can certainly create a more sophisticated graphical UI using C++ libraries like Qt or wxWidgets. These libraries provide extensive tools for building cross-platform graphical applications. However, for the MVP, consider starting with a simpler console-based UI to focus on the core functionality. Once the basic functionality is established, you can move on to developing a more complex graphical UI.

Here's a breakdown of the benefits of using OOP for this project:

Encapsulation: OOP allows you to encapsulate data and behavior within objects, promoting data integrity and code organization.

Modular Design: Divide the application into well-defined modules or classes, each responsible for specific tasks, making the code easier to understand and maintain.

Reusability: OOP facilitates code reuse by creating objects that can be used in different parts of the application or even in other projects.

Maintainability: OOP makes it easier to modify and extend the application without affecting unrelated parts of the code.

Code Readability: OOP code is generally more readable and easier to understand due to its structured approach and separation of concerns.

While a console-based UI is sufficient for the MVP, a graphical UI can enhance the user experience and make the application more intuitive. Consider using graphical UI libraries like Qt or wxWidgets once the basic functionality is in place.
