Sure, let's start with the technical design of the MVP for the car mileage validation application using C++.

Database Design

For the testing purpose, you can create a simple SQLite database that stores the necessary car information and mileage data. The database schema could include the following tables:

cars:

id: Unique identifier for each car record
vin: Vehicle identification number
model_year: Model year of the car
odometer: Current odometer reading
mileage_data:

id: Unique identifier for each mileage data record
model_year: Model year of the car (foreign key to the cars table)
expected_mileage: Expected mileage range for the car's model year
source: Source of the mileage data (e.g., manufacturer, industry standard)
Data Access Layer (DAL)

Create a C++ class to encapsulate the database interactions for both the cars and mileage_data tables. The DAL should provide methods for:

Adding new car records
Retrieving car information based on VIN or model year
Adding new mileage data records
Retrieving mileage data for a specific car model year
Mileage Validation Logic

Create a separate class to handle the mileage validation logic. This class should take as input the car's VIN, model year, and odometer reading and provide a method that:

Retrieves the expected mileage range from the DAL based on the car's model year
Compares the actual odometer reading with the expected mileage range
Determines whether the actual mileage falls within the expected range
Returns a validation result indicating whether the mileage is likely original or tampered with
User Interface (UI)

Create a simple console-based UI that allows users to:

Enter the car's VIN or model year
Provide the car's odometer reading
Receive the mileage validation result
Connecting to a Real Car Database

Once the MVP is functional with the SQLite database, you can extend the application to connect to a real car database. This will require additional steps such as:

Identifying a suitable real car database source (e.g., API, direct database access)
Establishing a connection to the real car database
Modifying the DAL to interact with the real database
Updating the UI to accommodate the real car database connection
Remember to handle potential errors and exceptions gracefully throughout the application.
