Minimum Viable Product (MVP)

The MVP for this application should focus on the core functionality of validating car mileage. It should be able to:

Collect car information: The application should gather relevant information about the car, including the vehicle identification number (VIN), model year, odometer reading, and service records.

Calculate expected mileage: Based on the car's model year and odometer reading, the application should calculate an expected mileage range using industry standards or manufacturer-provided data.

Compare expected and actual mileage: The application should compare the calculated expected mileage range with the actual odometer reading. If the actual mileage falls within the expected range, it suggests that the mileage is likely original.

Algorithm

The algorithm for validating car mileage can be divided into the following steps:

Input car information: Prompt the user to enter the car's VIN, model year, odometer reading, and any available service records.

Access mileage data: Access a database or web service that provides average mileage data for specific car models and years.

Calculate expected mileage range: Using the car's model year and odometer reading, calculate the expected mileage range based on the retrieved data.

Compare expected and actual mileage: Compare the calculated expected mileage range with the actual odometer reading.

Generate validation result: Determine whether the actual mileage falls within the expected range. If it does, indicate that the mileage is likely original. Otherwise, indicate that the mileage may be tampered with.

Considerations

Data Accuracy: The accuracy of the mileage validation depends heavily on the reliability of the mileage data used for comparison. Ensure the data source is trustworthy and up-to-date.

Mileage Factors: Consider factors that can affect mileage, such as driving habits, maintenance history, and geographical location.

Statistical Techniques: Employ statistical techniques to analyze mileage patterns and identify anomalies that suggest odometer tampering.

User Interface: Design a user-friendly interface that simplifies data input and clearly presents the validation results.
