A well-organized file structure is crucial for maintaining a project's structure and scalability. Here's a recommended file structure for your car mileage validation application in C++:

main.cpp: The main entry point for the application, responsible for launching the program and handling the overall flow.

Car.h: Defines the Car class, which encapsulates car information such as VIN, model year, and odometer reading.

Car.cpp: Implements the methods for the Car class.

MileageData.h: Defines the MileageData class, which stores mileage data for specific car models and years.

MileageData.cpp: Implements the methods for the MileageData class.

DatabaseManager.h: Defines the DatabaseManager class, responsible for interacting with the SQLite database.

DatabaseManager.cpp: Implements the methods for the DatabaseManager class.

MileageValidator.h: Defines the MileageValidator class, responsible for comparing actual mileage with expected mileage and determining validation results.

MileageValidator.cpp: Implements the methods for the MileageValidator class.

UI.h: Defines the UI class, responsible for handling user interactions and displaying information.

UI.cpp: Implements the methods for the UI class.

main.cpp: Includes necessary header files, creates instances of Car, DatabaseManager, MileageValidator, and UI classes, and orchestrates their interactions.

This file structure provides a clear separation of concerns and makes it easier to navigate and maintain the codebase. As the application grows in complexity, you can introduce additional modules and subdirectories to maintain a structured and organized code structure.

To start developing the application, follow these steps:

Create the project structure: Create directories for the source code (src), headers (include), and any additional resources (e.g., images, data files).

Implement the database layer: Create the SQLite database schema and write the DatabaseManager class to handle database interactions.

Develop the core classes: Implement the Car, MileageData, MileageValidator, and UI classes, ensuring they adhere to OOP principles and encapsulation.

Integrate the components: In main.cpp, create instances of the classes and connect them appropriately to handle user input, database interactions, mileage validation, and UI updates.

Test and refine: Thoroughly test the application to identify and fix any bugs or inconsistencies. Continuously refine the code to improve its efficiency, maintainability, and overall quality.

Remember to follow good coding practices, such as proper indentation, consistent naming conventions, and comprehensive documentation.
