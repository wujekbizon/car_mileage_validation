# Car Mileage Validation Project

## Introduction

This project aims to develop a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) application for validating car mileage using C++. The MVP will focus on the core functionality of gathering car information, calculating expected mileage, and comparing expected and actual mileage to determine the likelihood of odometer tampering.

## Project Structure

##### The project follows a well-organized file structure for maintainability and extensibility:

    ├── package.json (if using Node.js)
    ├── .gitignore
    ├── src

## Prerequisites

1. C++ Development Environment: Install a C++ development environment, such as Visual Studio or CodeBlocks, to write and compile C++ code.

2. Mileage Data Source: Access a reliable source of mileage data, such as a database or web service, to compare actual mileage against expected mileage.

## Core Functionality

##### The MVP focuses on the following core functionalities:

1. Input Car Information: Implement functions to prompt the user for car details, including VIN, model year, and odometer reading.

2. Access Mileage Data: Develop functions to access and retrieve mileage data for specific car models and years from the chosen data source.

3. Calculate Expected Mileage Range: Implement logic to calculate the expected mileage range based on the car's model year, odometer reading, and retrieved mileage data.

4. Compare Expected and Actual Mileage: Implement functions to compare the calculated expected mileage range with the actual odometer reading.

5. Generate Validation Result: Develop logic to determine whether the actual mileage falls within the expected range. If it does, indicate that the mileage is likely original. Otherwise, suggest that the mileage may be tampered with.

## Refining the Algorithm

##### To enhance the mileage validation process, consider the following:

1. Data Accuracy: Verify the accuracy and reliability of the mileage data source to ensure valid mileage comparisons.

2. Mileage Factors: Consider factors that influence mileage, such as driving habits, maintenance history, and geographical location, to refine the mileage validation process.

3. Statistical Techniques: Employ statistical techniques to analyze mileage patterns and identify anomalies that suggest odometer tampering.

4. User Interface: Design a user-friendly interface to simplify data input and clearly present the validation results.
